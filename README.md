My-IDE is an in-browser [Integrated Development Environment](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_development_environment) designed to do the basics.  It's minimal; that's the way I wanted it.

Serious props go to the people at Cloud9 and their [Ace Editor](http://ace.c9.io/), without which this would have been impossible.  

This type of thing isn't new.  It's been done before, but I needed an excuse to become familiar with [node.js](http://nodejs.org/) and spend a little time with Javascript.  There are a few things to do along with some refactoring, but it suits my needs.  More importantly, I wanted one IDE that could accommodate any number of mark-ups, most notably XQuery.

Besides installing the node js app

    npm install

[ace-builds](https://github.com/ajaxorg/ace-builds/) will need to be cloned into 

    public_html/static/js/
